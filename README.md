# SpringRestMVC
Spring Boot / REST sample project

The general idea is to start with an api that reflects ip and browser info.
Have database storing ip, device, location data (depending on how much my freetier instance of aws can store)
Rest api will be used to retrieve data based on above.
Will have POST and delete functionality, but not really relevant since this is more of a collection project.

Not sure how I would do it but would be neat if I could visualize the data. I want to see a heatmap of countries visiting my site, or build a map with icons of most popular device used from each country based on user agent.
